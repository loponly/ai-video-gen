"""
AI Video Generator Agents Configuration

This module defines the comprehensive agent team structure with consistent path management:
- Downloads: All downloaded content goes to 'downloads/' directory
- Outputs: All final results go to 'outputs/' directory
- Path validation is enforced through agent instructions

Agent Hierarchy (using sub_agents for LLM-Driven Delegation):
├── orchestration_agent (root coordinator using transfer_to_agent())
    ├── youtube_agent (downloads to downloads/)
    ├── video_editor_agent (outputs to outputs/)
    ├── image_to_video_agent (outputs to outputs/)
    ├── audio_processing_agent (outputs to outputs/)
    └── file_management_agent (system-wide file operations)

Capabilities:
- Video content discovery and downloading
- Comprehensive video editing and effects
- Image-to-video conversion and slideshows
- Audio processing and voice-over generation
- File management and organization
- End-to-end multimedia content creation workflows

Architecture:
- Uses Coordinator/Dispatcher pattern with LLM-Driven Delegation
- Orchestration agent routes tasks using transfer_to_agent() function calls
- Each specialist agent has clear descriptions for routing decisions
- Supports complex multi-agent workflows and task coordination
