9. **`normalize_audio`** - Normalize audio levels
10. **`trim_audio`** - Trim audio to specific time ranges

### File Management Tools (`tools/file/`)
1. **`copy_files`** - Copy files with structure preservation
2. **`move_files`** - Move/relocate files safely
3. **`create_directory`** - Create directories recursively
4. **`delete_files`** - Safe file deletion
5. **`compress_files`** - Create ZIP archives
6. **`extract_archive`** - Extract ZIP/TAR archives
7. **`list_directory`** - List directory contents with metadata
8. **`get_file_info`** - Get detailed file information
9. **`batch_rename`** - Rename multiple files with patterns
10. **`find_files`** - Search files with pattern matching

- Audio tools testing (with graceful library absence handling)
- File management operations testing
- Agent integration and tool assignment verification
- Error handling validation

### Test Results
- ✅ **16/16 tests passing**
- ✅ All existing ADK compliance tests still passing
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

## 🚀 Workflows Enabled

### 1. Complete Content Creation
```
YouTube Agent → Download → Video Editor → Audio Processing → Export
```

### 2. Image Slideshow with Narration
```
File Manager → Organize → Image-to-Video → Audio Processing → Sync
```

### 3. Voice-over Production
```
Audio Processing → TTS → Effects → Video Editor → Final Export
```

### 4. Multi-source Content
```
YouTube Agent → Multiple sources → Video Editor → File Manager → Archive
```

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Voice-over Generation
```python
result = text_to_speech(
    text="Welcome to our presentation",
    output_path="outputs/narration.mp3",
    voice_engine="gtts",
    language="en"
)
```

### File Organization
```python
result = copy_files(
    source_paths=["video1.mp4", "video2.mp4"],
    destination_path="downloads/project/",
    preserve_structure=True
)
```

### Audio Processing
```python
result = apply_audio_effects(
    audio_path="downloads/raw_audio.mp3",
    output_path="outputs/processed_audio.mp3",
    effects=[
        {"type": "normalize", "parameters": {"headroom": 0.1}},
        {"type": "fade", "parameters": {"fade_in": 1.0, "fade_out": 2.0}}
    ]
)
```
