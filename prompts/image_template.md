Input Scene:
"Scene 1: Introduction
“About 70% of the human body is made up of water, which is why water is considered vital for our health. It is recommended to drink at least 30 ml of water per kilogram of body weight every day.

It’s important not to drink water only when you’re thirsty, but to drink it regularly throughout the day — and to make a habit of consuming boiled or filtered water.”

Scene 2: Importance of Water
“Water plays an invaluable role in helping the body digest food properly, supporting cellular cleansing, and boosting overall energy levels. Here are four special reasons why you should drink water every day.”

Scene 3: 1. Stronger Teeth and Bones
“Are you surprised? This has been scientifically proven. We often highlight the benefits of milk and dairy products for bone health, but many people don’t realize the benefits of water. The minerals in water, especially fluoride (well-known for its role in strengthening teeth), help make bones and teeth stronger.”

Scene 4: 2. Healthier, Clearer Skin
“People spend a lot of money on expensive beauty products to reduce wrinkles and maintain youthful skin. But the best, most natural solution is simply water. Sometimes the best things for our health are the simplest and least expensive.”

Scene 5: 3. Supports a Healthy Urinary System
“Although rarely discussed, one of water’s greatest benefits is how it cleans and purifies the urinary system. Pure, natural water cleanses, hydrates, and flushes out toxins from the kidneys and bladder, supporting their health. However, if someone has a kidney disease flare-up, fluid intake must be regulated by a doctor.”

Scene 6: 4. Helps Maintain a Healthy Weight
“There’s no need to experiment with harsh or artificial weight loss supplements. Weight gain often occurs when the body cannot properly metabolize or excrete waste due to improper eating habits. In this case, water plays a crucial role in supporting metabolism, restoring balance, and aiding weight loss naturally. By making water a regular part of your routine, you’ll soon notice amazing results. It can reduce appetite more effectively than any pill.”
